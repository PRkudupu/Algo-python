    "### Iteration with Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "To iterate in Python, there are several options. A for loop can be used to iterate through a list or dictionary. Instead of the traditional for loop where we initialize a value i and increase / decrease it till it reaches an end value, Python's for loops are for-each in nature. This means that when you are iterating using a for loop over a list, you actually iterate over the items of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you also need the index values from the list while iterating, another possibility is to use enumerate, which is shown in an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional way to iterate in Python is with a while loop. Just as in other programming languages, the while loop will repeat while some conditional statement is true. You will see more on conditional statements shortly, but first, here are examples of iteration with for and while loops."
